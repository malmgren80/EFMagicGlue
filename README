EFMagicGlue is helpers for Entity Framework to follow repository and specification patterns. It is inspired by how Sharp Architecture (http://www.sharparchitecture.net/) uses NHibernate.

Features:
- ObjectContextManager that handles one or multiple ObjectContexts
- ObjectContexts are stored in a replaceble IObjectContextStorage. Different storages are implemented: Simple, Web and ThreadSafe
- Linq queries in repositories can be testable with linq to objects and List<T> (Fake implementation of IObjectSet<T>)
- Support for multiple databases
- Lifetime mangement of ObjectContext(s) with UnitOfWork
- Support for TransactionScope and distributed transactions

TODO:
- Move code in SpecificationBuilder to Specification
- Add T4-templates for generating POCO:s, repository and ObjectContext
- Remove usage of ServiceLocator
- Should be initialized with instance of IContextStorage and instance of IObjectContextFactory
- Should support DbContext and DbSet
